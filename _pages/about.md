I am assistant professor in philosophy of science at the University of Turin. 

My main research interests include quantitative studies of science, quantitative methods for the history of philosophy, and science policy and research evaluation. My studies have appeared in *Scientometrics*, *PLOS ONE*, *Synthese*, and *European Journal for Philosophy of Science*, among others. 

Before joining the University of Turin in 2022, I have worked at the Universities of Milan, Siena, and Tilburg.

My institutional page is [here](https://www.dfe.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?eugenio.petrovich#tab-profilo).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
