I am assistant professor in philosophy of science at the University of Turin.

My main research interests include quantitative studies of science, quantitative methods for the history of philosophy, and science policy and research evaluation. My studies have appeared in *Scientometrics*, *PLOS ONE*, *Synthese*, and *European Journal for Philosophy of Science*, among others. 

Before joining the University of Turin in 2022, I have worked at the Universities of Milan, Siena, and Tilburg.
